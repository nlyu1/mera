Proposition 1.1 (geodesics in half-plane model) Consider \\(\\mathbb H^2\\) in the ball model, the geodesic equations are derived by extremizing the length functional with Lagrangian given by the metric. Omitting the factor of \\(4\\): \\[ \\mathcal L = \\dfrac{\\dot x_1^2 + \\dot x_2^2}{(1-x_1^2-x_2^2)^2} \\] Hyperbolic Spaces Basic definitions Definition 1.4 (geodesic metric space) A metric space \\((X, d)\\) is geodesic if every two points \\(x, y\\) is joined by a path \\(\\overline{xy}\\) with length equal to \\(d(x, y)\\). Definition 1.5 (hyperbolic space) A geodesic metric space \\((X, d)\\) is \\(\\delta\\)-hyperbolic, for \\(\\delta \\geq 0\\), if for every \\(x, y, z\\in X\\), we have \\[ \\overline{xy} \\subset B_\\delta(\\overline{zx})\\cup B_\\delta(\\overline{zy}) \\] The space is hyperbolic if \\(\\delta\\)-hyperbolic for some \\(\\delta&gt;0\\). Any tree with length distance is \\(0\\)-hyperbolic. In such ideal hyperbolic spaces, geodesic triangles are tripods. Standard hyperbolic plane \\(\\mathbb H^2\\) is \\(\\log(\\sqrt 2+1)\\)-hyperbolic . Definition 1.6 (hyperbolic group) A finitely generated group \\(G\\) is word-hyperbolic if there is a finite generating set \\(S\\subset G\\) such that the Cayley graph \\(\\Gamma(G, S)\\) is hyperbolic w.r.t. the word metric \\(d_S\\). Definition 1.7 (Gromov product) Given a metric space \\((X, d)\\) and \\(x, y, z\\in X\\), the Gromov product is defined as \\[ (x, y)_z = \\dfrac{ d(x, z) + d(y, z) - d(x, y) } 2 \\] In the tree-case, the Gromov product is always \\(0\\). The product measures the precision of the triangle inequality by \\[ d(x, y) \\leq d(x, z) + d(y, z) \\iff 0 \\leq 2 (x, y)_z \\] Again, in the tree-case, \\((x, y)_z\\) measures how long \\(\\overline{zx}, \\overline{zy}\\) travel before diverging. Definition 1.8 (Hausdorff distance) Given \\(A, B\\subset X\\), the Hausdorff distance is \\[ d_H(A, B) = \\inf\\left\\{ \\epsilon | A\\subset B_\\epsilon(B), B\\subset B_\\epsilon(A) \\right\\} \\] It measures the minimal amount we have to expand \\(A, B\\) by for them to contain each other. Proposition 1.2 In a \\(\\delta\\)-hyperbolic space \\((X, d)\\): The initial segments of length \\((y, z)_x\\) of \\(\\overline{xy}\\) and \\(\\overline{xz}\\) are \\(2\\delta\\)-Hausdorff close. \\((y, z)_x\\) approximates within \\(2\\delta\\) the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(\\overline{yz}\\). TODO . Definition 1.9 (equivalence of geodesic rays) Two geodesic rays \\(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2:[0, \\infty)\\to X\\) are equivalent, written \\(\\gamma_1\\sim \\gamma_2\\), if \\(\\exists K&gt;0\\) such that \\[ d(\\gamma_1(\\forall t), \\gamma_2(t)) \\leq K \\] Transitivity follows from the triangle inequality, so \\(\\sim\\) is indeed an equivalence relation. Proposition 1.3 (equivalent characterization of geodesic equivalence) \\(\\gamma_1\\sim \\gamma_2\\) iff their images have finite Hausdorff distance. Boundary Definition 1.10 (geodesic boundary) Given a \\(\\delta\\)-hyperbolic space and base-point \\(x\\in X\\), The relative geodesic boundary of \\(X\\) w.r.t. \\(x\\) is \\[ \\partial_{x}^g X = \\{\\text{geodesic rays with } \\gamma(0)=x\\} / \\sim \\] The geodesic boundary of \\(X\\) is \\(\\partial^g X = \\text{geodesic rays} / \\sim\\). Definition 1.11 (convergence to infinity) Given a base-point \\(x\\in X\\) in a hyperbolic metric space, a sequence \\((x_n)\\) of points converges to infinity if \\[ \\liminf_{i, j\\to \\infty} (x_i, x_j)_x = \\infty \\] "],["bibliography.html", "Bibliography", " Bibliography "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
