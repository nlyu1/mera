Investigate the minimal-surface property of the Cayley graphs (at least an upper-bound) Progress log Main takeaways so far: \\(\\partial \\mathbb H^3\\cong S^2\\), and quasi-isometric metric spaces have the same Gromov boundary, so it suffices to find groups which are quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). By the Svarc-Milnor lemma (Corollary 5.4.13 in (Löh 2017)), the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds have Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\). Examples of groups with \\(S^2\\) Gromov boundary (from Regina): m003(-3, 1): \\(\\langle a, b| a^2b^2a^2b^{-1}ab^{-1}, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\\rangle\\). m003(-2, 3): \\(\\langle a, b|a^{-1}b^{-1}aba^{-1}bab^{-1}a^{-1}b^2, ab^{-1}a^{-1}baba^{-1}b^{-1}ab^3\\rangle\\). m003(-4, 3): \\(\\langle a, b|a^2bab^{-2}ab, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\\rangle\\). m003(-4, 1): \\(\\langle a, b|a^{-3}b^2abab^2, aba^3b^{-2}a^3b\\rangle\\). Jan 16: the word problem for candidate groups See section 3 for more details on (1-4) below. The approach in (5) is in progress in section 4. We have identified a class of hyperbolic groups with Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\), corresponding to the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic \\(3\\)-manifolds. We obtained a “census” of this set of groups from Regina’s database. Additionally, the database sorted the stored groups by the hyperbolic volume of its corresponding manifold, which roughly concurs with the simplicity of the presentation (number of generators, and length of the relations). There seems to be no established technology for constructing the Cayley graphs of such groups (up to a certain radius). Mathematica supports plotting Cayley graphs but only for finite-order groups. Computing the Cayley graphs requires solving the word problem. My first attempt has been understanding and implementing the Dehn algorithm, which yields a linear-time algorithm for solving the word problem. After carefully reading the proof (in hopes of understanding the algorithm), I found that the Dehn algorithm is quite computationally infeasible. Computing the Dehn presentation has exponential complexity in the hyperbolic constant, which is likely exponentially-intractible as well. I’m looking more into aother approach to solving the word problem: by representing the fundamental group as subgroups of the isometry group of the universal cover \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) (which should be the group of Mobius transforms, which admit a convenient matrix representation?). I intend to proceed by the following: Understand the isomorphism between fundamental groups and deck transformations. Understand the embedding of deck transformations into the isometry group of the universal cover. Understand the matrix representation of the isometry group of \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). Compute the matrix representations of select hyperbolic groups, solve the word problem, and write a program to compute the Cayley graphs. The resulting Cayley graph may not have neat tree-like structure. There is a chance that in order to understand which edges should correspond to the lattice sites (and to compute the size of a boundary patch), I may also need to dig into the construction of the quasi-isometry between the \\(\\pi_1\\) of closed hyperbolic \\(3\\)-manifolds and \\(\\mathbb H^3\\).

This works presents a perspective on the entanglement and correlator properties of tensor-network states by examining the geometry of the tensor network ansatz. Critical v. non-critical systems Definition 2.1 (two-point correlator) Given local operators \\(P_{x_1}, Q_{x_2}\\) supported on sites \\(x_1, x_2\\in \\mathcal L\\), the two-point correlator is defined as \\[ C(x_1, x_2) = \\langle P_{x_1}Q_{x_2}\\rangle- \\langle P_{x_1}\\rangle\\langle Q_{x_2}\\rangle \\] Where \\(\\langle O\\rangle\\) denotes the expectation w.r.t. the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. Known results for the decay of correlators, when the Hamiltonian features local interactions: Gapped Hamiltonian (i.e. finite separation between ground and excited spectrums): \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{|x_1 - x_2|/\\xi} \\] here \\(\\xi\\geq 0\\) is the correlation length. Such systems are also known as non-critical systems Gapless Hamiltonian i.e. critical systems: \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx |x_1 - x_2|^{-q} \\] Definition 2.2 (entanglement entropy) Given a block \\(A\\subset \\mathcal L\\) of the lattice, the entanglement entropy is \\[ S(A) = -\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho_A \\log_2 \\rho_A) \\] The following results are also known for the entanglement entropy in \\(D\\) dimensions: For gapped systems, \\(S(A) \\approx |\\partial A| \\approx L^{D-1}\\). Gapless systems exhibit mixed behavior: For Fermi surface dimension \\(\\Gamma &lt; D-1\\), the boundary law holds. Systems with \\(\\Gamma = D - 1\\) exhibit a logarithmic correction to the boundary law: \\[ S(A) \\approx L^{D-1}\\log L \\] Connection to tensor networks Assuming a generic homogeneous tensor network i.e. all tensors of the same type are copies of a single tensor, with coefficients chosen randomly, connectivity determines important properties about the correlators and entanglement entropy. Proposition 2.1 (geodesic distance and correlators) Given two sites \\(x_1, x_2\\in \\mathcal L\\) with geodesic distance \\(D(x_1, x_2)\\), \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha D(x_1, x_2)} \\] Proof: The transfer matrix which determines contraction has positive eigenvalues, maximally \\(1\\), and the correlator is obtained by evaluating an expression involving the \\(D(x_1, x_2)\\)-th power of the transfer matrix. This implies the following correlator bounds for MPS and MERA: \\(C_{\\mathrm{MPS}}(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha |x_1 - x_2|}\\). \\(C_{\\mathrm{MERA}}(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha \\log_2 |x_1 - x_2|} \\approx |x_1 - x_2|^{-q}\\). Proposition 2.2 (entanglement entropy and boundary size) Let \\(\\bar A = \\mathcal L - A\\) denote the complementary system with \\(|A|\\leq |\\bar A|\\), given a Schmidt decomposition of the ground state w.r.t. the partition with Schmidt rank \\(\\chi\\): \\[ |\\psi\\rangle= \\sum_{j=1}^{\\chi} \\lambda_j |\\psi^A_j\\rangle|\\psi^{\\bar A}_j\\rangle, \\quad \\sum \\lambda_j^2 = 1, \\quad \\chi\\leq |A| \\] The entanglement entropy is maximized when \\(\\lambda_{\\forall j} = 1/\\sqrt \\chi\\) \\[ S(A) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\chi} \\lambda_j^2 \\log \\dfrac 1 {\\lambda_j^2} \\leq \\log_2 \\chi \\] Given \\(A\\subset \\mathcal L\\), for every partition \\(\\Omega_A\\sqcup \\Omega_B\\) of the nodes in the tensor network with such that \\(\\Omega_A\\) contains all the free legs of \\(A\\), we can upper-bound the entanglement entropy according to \\[ S(A) \\leq |\\partial \\Omega_A| \\log_2\\chi \\] where \\(|\\partial \\Omega_A|\\) is the number of legs across the cut \\(\\Omega_A\\sqcup \\Omega_B\\), and \\(\\chi\\) is the bond dimension of the homogeneous tensor. In 1D-MPS, \\(|\\Omega_A|=2\\), yielding the saturation of entanglement entropy. In 1D-MERA, \\(|\\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=1}^{\\log L} 2 \\approx \\log L\\), yielding the logarithmic violation. In \\(D&gt;1\\) MERA, \\(|\\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=1}^{\\log L} L^{D-1}/2^z \\approx L^{D-1}\\). Only the shortest length-scale (i.e. least coarse-graining) contributes meaningfully to the entropy. Branched MERA The concluding section of (Evenbly and Vidal 2011) mentioned the idea of branching, subsequently developed in (Evenbly and Vidal 2014), Scaling of entanglement entropy in the (branching) MERA. The main contributions are: Generalization of MERA by introducing a branching parameter \\(b\\), with \\(b=1\\) corresponding to the known MERA. The \\(b=2^{D-1}\\)-branched MERA supports logarithmic area law in \\(D&gt;1\\) dimensions: \\(S(A) \\approx L^{D-1}\\log L\\). Numerical evidence that the upper-bound for entanglement entropy is saturated up to leading order. The paper identifies two regimes in the coarse-graining procedure: Shrinking regime: the size of the coarse-grained block shrinks as a result of the coarse-graining isometry. At this scale, the coarse-grained system is entangled with the complementary system. Stationary regime: the size of the coarse-grained block stays constant (or vanishes). At this scale and above, the coarse-grained system no longer contributes entanglement. The total entanglement entropy can be computed as \\[ S(A) \\propto |\\partial \\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=0}^{\\bar z} |\\partial A_z| \\] where \\(\\partial A_z\\) is the size of the boundary of the coarse-grain of \\(A\\) at scale \\(z\\). For the traditional MERA on lattice dimension \\(D\\), each coarse-graining maps \\(L \\mapsto L/2\\), so \\[ |\\partial A_{z+1}| = |\\partial A_z| 2^{-(D-1)} \\] with \\(A\\) being a hypercube of size \\(L\\), we have \\(\\bar z = \\log_2 L\\) and \\(|\\partial A_z|=L^{D-1}/2^z\\). In order to yield the desired \\(L^{D-1}\\log L\\) entropy, we need to multiplicatively correct \\(|\\partial A_z| \\mapsto |\\partial A_z| 2^{(D-1)z}\\) to obtain logarithmic violation \\[ S(A) \\propto \\sum_{z=0}^{\\bar z} \\dfrac{|\\partial A_z| 2^{(D-1)z}}{2^{(D-1)z}} = L^{D-1} \\log_2 L \\] This corresponds to introducing \\(2^{(D-1)}\\) copies of the coarse-grained site at each coarse-graining step.

Appendix A3: hyperbolic Riemmanian geometry (quite detailed introductory treatment). Hyperbolicity and the Word Problem. Main takeaways: Quasi-properties are only sensitive to behaviors on a large (but uniform) scale. Quasi-isometric invariance apply to Cayley graphs (up to changes in generating sets) and hyperbolicity. One key property of hyperbolic spaces is that local geodesics are close to global geodesics (lemma 3.3), which implies the contractability of loops in Cayley graphs and the Dehn presentation. Geometric definitions We first define quasi-properties, then proceed to apply the quasi-definitions to geodesics and hyperbolicity. Definition 3.1 (quasi-isometry) A map \\(\\phi:(X, d)\\to X(X&#39;, d&#39;)\\) is a \\((\\alpha_{\\geq 1}, \\beta_{\\geq 0})\\)-quasi-isometric embedding if \\(\\forall x, y\\in X\\): \\[ \\dfrac 1 {\\alpha} d(x, y) - \\beta \\leq d&#39;(\\phi(x), \\phi(y)) \\leq \\alpha d(x, y) + \\beta \\] \\(\\phi\\) is a quasi-isometry if, additionally, the expanded image of \\(\\phi(X)\\) covers \\(X&#39;\\) up to some uniform bound, i.e. \\(\\exists k_3\\geq 0\\) such that \\[ \\forall y\\in X&#39;, \\exists x\\in X: d&#39;(y, \\phi(x)) \\leq k_3 \\] Caveat: quasi-isometries are not bijective in general, e.g. \\(\\mathbb Z\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb R\\). Definition 3.2 (geodesics and hyperbolic spaces) Fixing a metric space \\((M, d)\\): A geodesic is an isometric embedding \\(\\gamma:I\\to M\\), i.e.  \\[ \\forall a, b\\in I: d(\\gamma(a), \\gamma(b)) = |a-b| \\tag{3.1} \\] A \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) quasi-geodesic is a \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\)-quasi-isometric embedding \\(I\\to M\\). A \\(k\\)-local geodesic is a path \\(\\gamma:I\\to M\\) such that (3.1) holds for all \\(a, b\\in I\\) with \\(|a-b|\\leq k\\). A metric space \\((M, d)\\) is a geodesic space if any two points are connected by a geodesic. Quasi-geodesic spaces are defined analogously. A geodesic metric space is \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic if for any geodesic triangle \\([a, b], [b, c], [a, c]\\), every edge is contained in the \\(\\eta\\)-neighborhood of the other two edges. The space is hyperbolic if it is \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic for some \\(\\eta\\geq 0\\). Geodesics in the differential geometric sense are more analogous to “local geodesics” in the definitions above. Definition 3.3 (Cayley graph) Given a group \\(G\\) and a generating set \\(S\\), the Cayley graph \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) of \\(G\\) w.r.t \\(S\\) is the undirected graph defined by Vertices denoting elements of \\(G\\), and Edges given by \\(\\{(g, gs): g\\in G, s\\in S\\cup S^{-1}-\\{1\\}\\}\\). Each Cayley graph is endowed with the natural word metric, with each edge having unit length. Definition 3.4 (hyperbolic group) A finitely generated group \\(G\\) is hyperbolic if the Cayley graph of \\(G\\) with the word metric is a hyperbolic space. We also quote the following results, which state that hyperbolicity and Cayley graphs are quasi-isometric invariants. Lemma 3.1 ((Löh 2017), prop. 5.2.5) Given finite generating sets \\(S, S&#39;\\) for a group \\(G\\), there exists a quasi-isometry from \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) to \\(\\Delta(G, S&#39;)\\) and vice versa. Lemma 3.2 ((Löh 2017), corollary 7.2.13) Given two quasi-isometric geodesic spaces \\(X, X&#39;\\), \\(X\\) is hyperbolic iff \\(X&#39;\\) is. Quasi-geodesics in hyperbolic spaces This section recounts in greater detail (Löh 2017), section 7.2. We feel that this is necessary to Obtain concrete intuition for how hyperbolicity imply the relation between local and global structures. Understand the Dehn algorithm for solving the word problem, needed for plotting Cayley graphs. Lemma 3.3 (local geodesic approximation) In an \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic space \\(X\\), for every \\(k_{&gt;8\\eta}\\)-local geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0, L]\\to X\\) and geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0, L&#39;]\\to X\\) with the same endpoints, the image \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) is contained in the \\(2\\eta\\)-neighborhood of \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39;\\). Proof: Pick a point \\(x=\\gamma(t)\\) at maximal distance from \\(\\gamma&#39;\\). First suppose \\(t, L-t &gt; 4\\eta\\). By \\(k_{&gt;8\\eta}\\) local-geodesic condition, pick a subarc of length in \\((8\\eta, k)\\) with endpoints \\(y, z\\in \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) and midpoint \\(x\\). Let \\(y&#39;, z&#39;\\) be the closest points on \\(\\gamma&#39;\\) to \\(y, z\\), respectively. Then \\([y, z]\\) (a subarc of \\(\\gamma\\) through \\(x\\)), \\([y, y&#39;]\\), and \\([z, y&#39;]\\) form a geodesic triangle. By \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic condition, there exists \\(w\\) on \\([y, y&#39;]\\) or \\([y&#39;, z]\\) such that \\(d(w, x)&lt;\\eta\\). Claim: \\(w\\) cannot exist on \\([y, y&#39;]\\) (so must be on \\([y&#39;, z]\\)), else this contradicts the maximality of \\(x\\): Since \\(L([y, x])&gt;4\\eta\\) and \\(L([w, x])&lt;\\eta\\), by the triangle inequality, \\[ L([y, w]) &gt; 3\\eta &gt; L([w, x]) \\] This implies that \\(d(x, y&#39;) &lt; d(y, y&#39;)\\). Combined with the extremality of \\(y&#39;\\) w.r.t. \\(y\\), we contradict the construction of \\(x\\) by \\[ d(x, \\gamma&#39;) &lt; d(x, y&#39;) &lt; d(y, y&#39;) = d(y, \\gamma&#39;) \\] Again, \\([y&#39;, z], [y&#39;, z&#39;], [z, z&#39;]\\) form a geodesic triangle, and by \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic condition, there exists \\(w&#39;\\) on \\([z, z&#39;]\\cup [y&#39;, z&#39;]\\) such that \\(d(w&#39;, w)&lt;\\eta\\). Claim: \\(w&#39;\\) cannot exist on \\([z, z&#39;]\\), else contradicting the maximality of \\(x\\): Assuming by contradiction, \\(d(x, w&#39;) \\leq d(x, w) + d(w, w&#39;) &lt; 2\\eta\\), then \\[ d(z, w&#39;) \\geq d(x, z)_{&gt;4\\eta} - d(x, w&#39;)_{&lt;2\\eta} &gt; 2\\eta &gt; d(x, w&#39;) \\implies d(x, z&#39;) &lt; d(z, z&#39;) \\] Then \\(d(x, \\gamma) \\leq d(x, z&#39;) &lt; d(z, z&#39;) = d(z, \\gamma)\\), contradicting the maximality of \\(x\\). Combining the two results, we obtain \\(d(x, \\gamma) &lt; 2\\eta\\). For one of \\(t, L-t &lt; 4\\eta\\), assume w.l.o.g. that \\(t&lt;4\\eta\\) and apply the same construction to the geodesic triangle \\([\\gamma_0, z, z&#39;]\\). For the trivial case \\(t, L-t &lt; 4\\eta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) is a geodesic. Figure 3.1: Hypothetical (for contradiction) constructions are in green. Geodesics are in blue. Dehn algorithm This part follows section 7.4.1, which efficiently solves the word problem for hyperbolic groups. The main idea of the proof is as follows: By lemma 3.3, local geodesics are close to global geodesics. This implies the shortcut lemma 3.4, which means that every loop in the Cayley graph (which is piecewise geodesic) of a hyperbolic group contains a geodesic shortcut. Null-homotopic words correspond to loops in the Cayley graph, and Dehn relations correspond to rules with which to “shrink” the loops. The shortcut lemma implies the existence of a Dehn presentation in which loops can always be shrunk to a smaller loops. Definition 3.5 (Dehn presentation) A finite presentation \\(\\langle S|R\\rangle\\) is a Dehn presentation if there exists words \\((u_1, v_1), \\dots, (u_n, v_n)\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\) such that \\(R = \\{u_1 v_1^{-1}, \\dots, u_n v_n^{-1}\\}\\). For all \\(j\\), \\(|v_j| \\leq |u_j|\\). For all nontrivial null-homotopic words \\(w\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\), some \\(u_j\\) is a subword of \\(w\\). Note that \\(v_j\\) can be null. For example, the free group of rank \\(2\\) has Dehn representation \\(v_1=\\dots=v_4=1\\), and \\[ u_1 = xx^{-1}, \\quad u_2=x^{-1}x, \\quad u_3=yy^{-1}, \\quad u_4=y^{-1}y \\] Given a Dehn presentation, the word problem is solvable in time \\(O(|w|)\\) by a replacement algorithm. Lemma 3.4 (shortcuts in cycles in hyperbolic groups) Given an \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic group \\(G\\), a finite generating set \\(S\\) and \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) being \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic, if \\(\\gamma:[0, n]\\to \\Delta(N, G)\\) is a piecewise-geodesic cycle (of length \\(n\\)), then there exists a restriction \\(\\gamma_{[t, t&#39;]}\\) with \\(t, t&#39;\\in [0, n]\\) such that \\[ L(\\gamma_{[t, t&#39;]}) \\leq 8\\eta \\] and such that \\(\\gamma_{|[t, t&#39;]}\\) is not geodesic. Proof: The lemma equivalently claims that there is no \\(c_{&gt;8\\eta}\\)-local geodesic cycle, and we argue by contradiction. Since \\(\\gamma\\) is a loop, we first have \\(n&gt;8\\eta\\). By lemma 3.3, \\(\\gamma\\) is \\(2\\eta\\)-close to the trivial geodesic at \\(\\gamma_0\\), so \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) is in the \\(2\\eta\\)-ball centered at \\(\\gamma_0\\). Then we obtain the following contradiction (the last equality follows by the local geodesic condition): \\[ 4\\eta \\geq \\mathrm{diam}\\, B_{2\\delta}(\\gamma_0) \\geq d(\\gamma_0, \\gamma_{5\\eta}) = 5\\eta \\] Note that the \\(8\\eta\\) here is inherited from lemma 3.3. Theorem 3.1 (Dehn presentations and hyperbolic groups) Given a hyperbolic group \\(G\\) and a finite generating set \\(S\\), there exists a finite set \\(R\\subset (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\) such that \\(\\langle S|R\\rangle\\) is a Dehn presentation of \\(G\\). Proof: Consider the canonical presentation \\(\\pi:F(S)\\to G\\). Using the shortcut lemma, consider the finite set \\[ R = \\left\\{ uv^{-1} \\,|\\, u, v\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*: d(1, \\pi(u)) &lt; |u| \\leq \\lceil 8\\eta\\rceil + 2, \\,\\, |v|=d(1, \\pi(u)), \\,\\,\\pi(u)=\\pi(v) \\right\\} \\tag{3.2} \\] The interpretation for each constraint are: \\(|v|=d_s(1, \\pi(u))\\): \\(v\\) is the geodesic connecting the identity to \\(u\\), i.e.  the word \\(v\\) is the “canonical word” representing \\(u\\). \\(\\pi(u)=\\pi(v)\\): the geometric realization of \\(uv^{-1}\\) forms a loop. The canonical isomorphism \\(\\pi/\\langle R\\rangle^{\\unlhd}:\\langle S|R\\rangle\\to G\\) is surjective by the \\(\\pi(u)=\\pi(v)\\) constraint, and we next argue that it is injective, i.e.  every null-homotopic word satisfies \\(w\\in \\langle R\\rangle^{\\unlhd}\\). This can be argued inductively by applying the shortcut lemma: If \\(w\\) contains a subword \\(ss^{-1}\\), then \\((ss^{-1})1\\in R\\). Remove \\(ss^{-1}\\) by conjugating \\(w=a(ss^{-1})b\\) with \\(a(s^{-1}s)a^{-1}\\) and apply the inductive hypothesis. If \\(w\\) contains no subword of the form \\(ww^{-1}\\), then \\(w\\) realizes a cycle; apply the shortcut lemma to obtain \\(w=w&#39;uw&#39;&#39;\\) and replace \\(u\\mapsto v\\) by conjugation, the apply the inductive hypothesis. Gromov-boundaries This section discusses the relevant results in Chapter 8 of (Löh 2017). Intuitively, the definition of boundary should satisfy: To every metric space \\(X\\) a (preferably compact) topological space \\(X_\\infty\\). Quasi-isometric invariance: \\(X\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(X&#39;\\iff X_\\infty\\) is homeomorphic to \\(X&#39;_\\infty\\). Functoriality: a quasi-isometric embedding \\(X\\to Y\\) induces a continuous map \\(X_\\infty\\to Y_\\infty\\) compatible with composition: \\((g\\circ f)_\\infty = g_\\infty\\circ f_\\infty\\), for \\(f, g\\) quasi-isometric embeddings. The main idea is to define points on the boundary as equivalence classes of geodesic rays. Definition 3.6 (Gromov boundary) Two quasi-geodesic rays \\(\\gamma, \\gamma&#39;:[0, \\infty)\\to X\\) are equivalent if they have finite Hausdorff distance, i.e. \\(\\exists c&gt;0\\) such that \\[ \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma \\subset B_c(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39;), \\quad \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39; \\subset B_c(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma) \\] The Gromov boundary is defined as the set of quasi-geodesic rays modulo \\(\\sim\\) above, with the topology defined as follows: Given \\((x_n), x\\subset \\partial X\\), we say \\(x_n\\to x\\) if there exists representative rays \\((\\gamma_n), \\gamma\\) such that every subsequence of \\((\\gamma_n)\\) contains a subsequence which converges to \\(\\gamma\\) uniformly on compact subsets of \\([0, \\infty)\\). Importantly, the Gromov boundary of \\(\\mathbb H^n\\) is \\(S^{n-1}\\) ((Löh 2017), Example 8.3.5). Theorem 3.2 (quasi-isometric invariance of Gromov boundary) For two geodesic metric spaces \\(X, X&#39;\\), we have \\(\\partial X\\cong \\partial X&#39;\\iff X, X&#39;\\) are quasi-isometric to one another. The immediate implications of this result are as follows: The Gromov boundaries of hyperbolic groups are well-defined as the Gromov boundaries of their Cayley graphs, regardless of the generating sets. Groups which are quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) have Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\). Interesting Misc The Gromov boundary of free groups (of nontrivial rank) are Cantor sets, which is not homeomorphic to \\(S^1\\). Since Gromov boundary is a quasi-isometric invariant, it follows that nontrivial free groups are not quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic space \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). Bibliography Löh, Clara. 2017.
