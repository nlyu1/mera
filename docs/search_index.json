Construct their Cayley graphs out to a fixed radius, embedding endpoints on \\(S^2\\). Investigate the minimal-surface property of the Cayley graphs (at least an upper-bound) Progress log Main takeaways so far: \\(\\partial \\mathbb H^3\\cong S^2\\), and quasi-isometric metric spaces have the same Gromov boundary, so it suffices to find groups which are quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). By the Svarc-Milnor lemma (Corollary 5.4.13 in (Löh 2017)), the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds have Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\). Examples of groups with \\(S^2\\) Gromov boundary (from Regina): m003(-3, 1): \\(\\langle a, b| a^2b^2a^2b^{-1}ab^{-1}, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\\rangle\\). m003(-2, 3): \\(\\langle a, b|a^{-1}b^{-1}aba^{-1}bab^{-1}a^{-1}b^2, ab^{-1}a^{-1}baba^{-1}b^{-1}ab^3\\rangle\\). m003(-4, 3): \\(\\langle a, b|a^2bab^{-2}ab, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\\rangle\\). m003(-4, 1): \\(\\langle a, b|a^{-3}b^2abab^2, aba^3b^{-2}a^3b\\rangle\\). Jan 16: the word problem for candidate groups See section 3 for more details on (1-4) below. The approach in (5) is in progress in section 4. We have identified a class of hyperbolic groups with Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\), corresponding to the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic \\(3\\)-manifolds. We obtained a “census” of this set of groups from Regina’s database. Additionally, the database sorted the stored groups by the hyperbolic volume of its corresponding manifold, which roughly concurs with the simplicity of the presentation (number of generators, and length of the relations). There seems to be no established technology for constructing the Cayley graphs of such groups (up to a certain radius). Mathematica supports plotting Cayley graphs but only for finite-order groups. Computing the Cayley graphs requires solving the word problem. My first attempt has been understanding and implementing the Dehn algorithm, which yields a linear-time algorithm for solving the word problem. After carefully reading the proof (in hopes of understanding the algorithm), I found that the Dehn algorithm is quite computationally infeasible. Computing the Dehn presentation has exponential complexity in the hyperbolic constant, which is likely exponentially-intractible as well. I’m investigating aother approach to solving the word problem: by representing the fundamental group as subgroups of the isometry group of the universal cover \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) (which should be the group of Mobius transforms, which admit a convenient matrix representation?). I intend to proceed by the following: Understand the isomorphism between fundamental groups and deck transformations. Understand the embedding of deck transformations into the isometry group of the universal cover. Understand the matrix representation of the isometry group of \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). Compute the matrix representations of select hyperbolic groups, solve the word problem, and write a program to compute the Cayley graphs. The resulting Cayley graph may not have neat tree-like structure. There is a chance that in order to understand which edges should correspond to the lattice sites (and to compute the size of a boundary patch), I may also need to dig into the construction of the quasi-isometry between the \\(\\pi_1\\) of closed hyperbolic \\(3\\)-manifolds and \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). Jan 26: Visualizing the Cayley graph of the Weeks manifold I found the holonomy representation of the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold as a subgroup of \\(O(3, 1)\\), after tampering with SnapPy a bit. With this faithful representation in hand, we can compute the Cayley graph efficiently, up to floating-point errors. On the theoretical side, I delved into the Svarc-Milnor lemma, which gives the explicit construction of the quasi-isometry between (1) the Cayley graph of a fundamental group of a manifold, and (2) the universal cover of the manifold. I believe that the quasi-isometric embedding given by this lemma is the one we need to “visualize” the Cayley graph as a discrete tiling of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). In particular, the vertices of the image of the Cayley graph under this embedding are simply the image of an arbitrary basepoint (e.g. the “center” of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\)) under the corresponding deck transformations. With the matrix representation of the fundamental group in hand, we can compute the image of the basepoint under the matrix representation in the hyperboloid model, then change to the familiar Poincaré disk (ball) model to visualize the Cayley graph in 3D. Theoretically, we can also explicitly compute the quasi-isometric constants for the particular case of the Weeks manifold. I have made some numerical progress in computing the Cayley graph, but a very rudimentary implementation of visualizing it did not yield the neat, desired “tiling” of the Poincaré ball. This may be a bug in implementation, or something more fundamental (e.g. the Svarc-Milnor quasi-isometry does not guarantee a neat “tiling” in the visual sense). Feb 5: The Weeks tiling (finally) New results are documented in Section 5. Summary: With disentanglers, the 1D MERA graph is indeed quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). The 2D MERA graph is locally quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\), but not globally so. This highlights the special dimensionality. In 1D, the \\(\\mathbb R^1\\) MERA nicely wraps around \\(S^1\\) by a covering map, under which translational symmetry maps onto the rotational symmetry of \\(S^1\\) by boundary conditions. In 2D, there is no analogous periodic boundary condition which wraps a lattice on \\(\\mathbb R^2\\) onto \\(S^2\\). There is no covering map \\(\\mathbb R^2\\to S^2\\) since \\(S^2\\) is simply connected. I believe there’re results which rule out self-similar lattices on \\(S^2\\). This verifies our intuition that 1D MERA is quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\), but the 2D MERA is not quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) . I constructed the Svarc-Milnor quasi-isometry for a Cayley graph of the Weeks manifold group. A key realization is that the resulting graph essentially represents a regular tiling of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). Using the tiling property, I refined the area-law argument for our construction (hypothesis 5.1). Some questions: After recognizing the tiling property, I realized that our construction seems very similar to hyperbolic-invariant MERA (hyMERA), (Evenbly 2017). HyMERA takes a tiling of \\(\\mathbb H^2\\) and constructs the TN graph by placing vertices at the extremal points of the tiles, and edges connecting the vertices (effective “tracing out” the tiling). Our construction place vertices at the center of the tiles, and edges connecting the vertices denoting neighboring tiles. The tiling property seems “more fundamental” to our arguments, and it may be more general (I’m looking more into this). There is a corresponding hyMERA construction for the Weeks manifold. The only differences seem to be: All the tensors in our construction have the same rank. while in the hyMERA construction, the rank vary depending on the vertex. The tensors in our construction have high rank (equal to the number of faces in the domain) compared to hyMERA, whose rank is bounded by maximum degree of a vertex in the tiling. The original hyMERA paper provides many future directions, e.g. finding an efficient optimization algorithm for the tensors.

This works presents a perspective on the entanglement and correlator properties of tensor-network states by examining the geometry of the tensor network ansatz. Critical v. non-critical systems Definition 2.1 (two-point correlator) Given local operators \\(P_{x_1}, Q_{x_2}\\) supported on sites \\(x_1, x_2\\in \\mathcal L\\), the two-point correlator is defined as \\[ C(x_1, x_2) = \\langle P_{x_1}Q_{x_2}\\rangle- \\langle P_{x_1}\\rangle\\langle Q_{x_2}\\rangle \\] Where \\(\\langle O\\rangle\\) denotes the expectation w.r.t. the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. Known results for the decay of correlators, when the Hamiltonian features local interactions: Gapped Hamiltonian (i.e. finite separation between ground and excited spectrums): \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{|x_1 - x_2|/\\xi} \\] here \\(\\xi\\geq 0\\) is the correlation length. Such systems are also known as non-critical systems Gapless Hamiltonian i.e. critical systems: \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx |x_1 - x_2|^{-q} \\] Definition 2.2 (entanglement entropy) Given a block \\(A\\subset \\mathcal L\\) of the lattice, the entanglement entropy is \\[ S(A) = -\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho_A \\log_2 \\rho_A) \\] The following results are also known for the entanglement entropy in \\(D\\) dimensions: For gapped systems, \\(S(A) \\approx |\\partial A| \\approx L^{D-1}\\). Gapless systems exhibit mixed behavior: For Fermi surface dimension \\(\\Gamma &lt; D-1\\), the boundary law holds. Systems with \\(\\Gamma = D - 1\\) exhibit a logarithmic correction to the boundary law: \\[ S(A) \\approx L^{D-1}\\log L \\] Connection to tensor networks Assuming a generic homogeneous tensor network i.e. all tensors of the same type are copies of a single tensor, with coefficients chosen randomly, connectivity determines important properties about the correlators and entanglement entropy. Proposition 2.1 (geodesic distance and correlators) Given two sites \\(x_1, x_2\\in \\mathcal L\\) with geodesic distance \\(D(x_1, x_2)\\), \\[ C(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha D(x_1, x_2)} \\] Proof: The transfer matrix which determines contraction has positive eigenvalues, maximally \\(1\\), and the correlator is obtained by evaluating an expression involving the \\(D(x_1, x_2)\\)-th power of the transfer matrix. This implies the following correlator bounds for MPS and MERA: \\(C_{\\mathrm{MPS}}(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha |x_1 - x_2|}\\). \\(C_{\\mathrm{MERA}}(x_1, x_2) \\approx e^{-\\alpha \\log_2 |x_1 - x_2|} \\approx |x_1 - x_2|^{-q}\\). Proposition 2.2 (entanglement entropy and boundary size) Let \\(\\bar A = \\mathcal L - A\\) denote the complementary system with \\(|A|\\leq |\\bar A|\\), given a Schmidt decomposition of the ground state w.r.t. the partition with Schmidt rank \\(\\chi\\): \\[ |\\psi\\rangle= \\sum_{j=1}^{\\chi} \\lambda_j |\\psi^A_j\\rangle|\\psi^{\\bar A}_j\\rangle, \\quad \\sum \\lambda_j^2 = 1, \\quad \\chi\\leq |A| \\] The entanglement entropy is maximized when \\(\\lambda_{\\forall j} = 1/\\sqrt \\chi\\) \\[ S(A) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\chi} \\lambda_j^2 \\log \\dfrac 1 {\\lambda_j^2} \\leq \\log_2 \\chi \\] Given \\(A\\subset \\mathcal L\\), for every partition \\(\\Omega_A\\sqcup \\Omega_B\\) of the nodes in the tensor network with such that \\(\\Omega_A\\) contains all the free legs of \\(A\\), we can upper-bound the entanglement entropy according to \\[ S(A) \\leq |\\partial \\Omega_A| \\log_2\\chi \\] where \\(|\\partial \\Omega_A|\\) is the number of legs across the cut \\(\\Omega_A\\sqcup \\Omega_B\\), and \\(\\chi\\) is the bond dimension of the homogeneous tensor. In 1D-MPS, \\(|\\Omega_A|=2\\), yielding the saturation of entanglement entropy. In 1D-MERA, \\(|\\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=1}^{\\log L} 2 \\approx \\log L\\), yielding the logarithmic violation. In \\(D&gt;1\\) MERA, \\(|\\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=1}^{\\log L} L^{D-1}/2^z \\approx L^{D-1}\\). Only the shortest length-scale (i.e. least coarse-graining) contributes meaningfully to the entropy. Branched MERA The concluding section of (Evenbly and Vidal 2011) mentioned the idea of branching, subsequently developed in (Evenbly and Vidal 2014), Scaling of entanglement entropy in the (branching) MERA. The main contributions are: Generalization of MERA by introducing a branching parameter \\(b\\), with \\(b=1\\) corresponding to the known MERA. The \\(b=2^{D-1}\\)-branched MERA supports logarithmic area law in \\(D&gt;1\\) dimensions: \\(S(A) \\approx L^{D-1}\\log L\\). Numerical evidence that the upper-bound for entanglement entropy is saturated up to leading order. The paper identifies two regimes in the coarse-graining procedure: Shrinking regime: the size of the coarse-grained block shrinks as a result of the coarse-graining isometry. At this scale, the coarse-grained system is entangled with the complementary system. Stationary regime: the size of the coarse-grained block stays constant (or vanishes). At this scale and above, the coarse-grained system no longer contributes entanglement. The total entanglement entropy can be computed as \\[ S(A) \\propto |\\partial \\Omega_A| = \\sum_{z=0}^{\\bar z} |\\partial A_z| \\] where \\(\\partial A_z\\) is the size of the boundary of the coarse-grain of \\(A\\) at scale \\(z\\). For the traditional MERA on lattice dimension \\(D\\), each coarse-graining maps \\(L \\mapsto L/2\\), so \\[ |\\partial A_{z+1}| = |\\partial A_z| 2^{-(D-1)} \\] with \\(A\\) being a hypercube of size \\(L\\), we have \\(\\bar z = \\log_2 L\\) and \\(|\\partial A_z|=L^{D-1}/2^z\\). In order to yield the desired \\(L^{D-1}\\log L\\) entropy, we need to multiplicatively correct \\(|\\partial A_z| \\mapsto |\\partial A_z| 2^{(D-1)z}\\) to obtain logarithmic violation \\[ S(A) \\propto \\sum_{z=0}^{\\bar z} \\dfrac{|\\partial A_z| 2^{(D-1)z}}{2^{(D-1)z}} = L^{D-1} \\log_2 L \\] This corresponds to introducing \\(2^{(D-1)}\\) copies of the coarse-grained site at each coarse-graining step.

Main takeaways: Quasi-properties are only sensitive to behaviors on a large (but uniform) scale. Quasi-isometric invariance apply to Cayley graphs (up to changes in generating sets) and hyperbolicity. One key property of hyperbolic spaces is that local geodesics are close to global geodesics (lemma 3.3), which implies the contractability of loops in Cayley graphs and the Dehn presentation. Geometric definitions We first define quasi-properties, then proceed to apply the quasi-definitions to geodesics and hyperbolicity. Definition 3.1 (quasi-isometry) A map \\(\\phi:(X, d)\\to X(X&#39;, d&#39;)\\) is a \\((\\alpha_{\\geq 1}, \\beta_{\\geq 0})\\)-quasi-isometric embedding if \\(\\forall x, y\\in X\\): \\[ \\dfrac 1 {\\alpha} d(x, y) - \\beta \\leq d&#39;(\\phi(x), \\phi(y)) \\leq \\alpha d(x, y) + \\beta \\] \\(\\phi\\) is a quasi-isometry if, additionally, the expanded image of \\(\\phi(X)\\) covers \\(X&#39;\\) up to some uniform bound, i.e. \\(\\exists k_3\\geq 0\\) such that \\[ \\forall y\\in X&#39;, \\exists x\\in X: d&#39;(y, \\phi(x)) \\leq k_3 \\] Caveat: quasi-isometries are not bijective in general, e.g. \\(\\mathbb Z\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb R\\). Definition 3.2 (geodesics and hyperbolic spaces) Fixing a metric space \\((M, d)\\): A geodesic is an isometric embedding \\(\\gamma:I\\to M\\), i.e.  \\[ \\forall a, b\\in I: d(\\gamma(a), \\gamma(b)) = |a-b| \\tag{3.1} \\] A \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) quasi-geodesic is a \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\)-quasi-isometric embedding \\(I\\to M\\). A \\(k\\)-local geodesic is a path \\(\\gamma:I\\to M\\) such that (3.1) holds for all \\(a, b\\in I\\) with \\(|a-b|\\leq k\\). A metric space \\((M, d)\\) is a geodesic space if any two points are connected by a geodesic. Quasi-geodesic spaces are defined analogously. A geodesic metric space is \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic if for any geodesic triangle \\([a, b], [b, c], [a, c]\\), every edge is contained in the \\(\\eta\\)-neighborhood of the other two edges. The space is hyperbolic if it is \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic for some \\(\\eta\\geq 0\\). Geodesics in the differential geometric sense are more analogous to “local geodesics” in the definitions above. Definition 3.3 (Cayley graph) Given a group \\(G\\) and a generating set \\(S\\), the Cayley graph \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) of \\(G\\) w.r.t \\(S\\) is the undirected graph defined by Vertices denoting elements of \\(G\\), and Edges given by \\(\\{(g, gs): g\\in G, s\\in S\\cup S^{-1}-\\{1\\}\\}\\). Each Cayley graph is endowed with the natural word metric, with each edge having unit length. Definition 3.4 (hyperbolic group) A finitely generated group \\(G\\) is hyperbolic if the Cayley graph of \\(G\\) with the word metric is a hyperbolic space. We also quote the following results, which state that hyperbolicity and Cayley graphs are quasi-isometric invariants. Lemma 3.1 ((Löh 2017), prop. 5.2.5) Given finite generating sets \\(S, S&#39;\\) for a group \\(G\\), there exists a quasi-isometry from \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) to \\(\\Delta(G, S&#39;)\\) and vice versa. Lemma 3.2 ((Löh 2017), corollary 7.2.13) Given two quasi-isometric geodesic spaces \\(X, X&#39;\\), \\(X\\) is hyperbolic iff \\(X&#39;\\) is. Quasi-geodesics in hyperbolic spaces This section recounts in greater detail (Löh 2017), section 7.2. We feel that this is necessary to Obtain concrete intuition for how hyperbolicity imply the relation between local and global structures. Understand the Dehn algorithm for solving the word problem, needed for plotting Cayley graphs. Lemma 3.3 (local geodesic approximation) In an \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic space \\(X\\), for every \\(k_{&gt;8\\eta}\\)-local geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0, L]\\to X\\) and geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0, L&#39;]\\to X\\) with the same endpoints, the image \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) is contained in the \\(2\\eta\\)-neighborhood of \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39;\\). Proof: Pick a point \\(x=\\gamma(t)\\) at maximal distance from \\(\\gamma&#39;\\). First suppose \\(t, L-t &gt; 4\\eta\\). By \\(k_{&gt;8\\eta}\\) local-geodesic condition, pick a subarc of length in \\((8\\eta, k)\\) with endpoints \\(y, z\\in \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) and midpoint \\(x\\). Let \\(y&#39;, z&#39;\\) be the closest points on \\(\\gamma&#39;\\) to \\(y, z\\), respectively. Then \\([y, z]\\) (a subarc of \\(\\gamma\\) through \\(x\\)), \\([y, y&#39;]\\), and \\([z, y&#39;]\\) form a geodesic triangle. By \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic condition, there exists \\(w\\) on \\([y, y&#39;]\\) or \\([y&#39;, z]\\) such that \\(d(w, x)&lt;\\eta\\). Claim: \\(w\\) cannot exist on \\([y, y&#39;]\\) (so must be on \\([y&#39;, z]\\)), else this contradicts the maximality of \\(x\\): Since \\(L([y, x])&gt;4\\eta\\) and \\(L([w, x])&lt;\\eta\\), by the triangle inequality, \\[ L([y, w]) &gt; 3\\eta &gt; L([w, x]) \\] This implies that \\(d(x, y&#39;) &lt; d(y, y&#39;)\\). Combined with the extremality of \\(y&#39;\\) w.r.t. \\(y\\), we contradict the construction of \\(x\\) by \\[ d(x, \\gamma&#39;) &lt; d(x, y&#39;) &lt; d(y, y&#39;) = d(y, \\gamma&#39;) \\] Again, \\([y&#39;, z], [y&#39;, z&#39;], [z, z&#39;]\\) form a geodesic triangle, and by \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic condition, there exists \\(w&#39;\\) on \\([z, z&#39;]\\cup [y&#39;, z&#39;]\\) such that \\(d(w&#39;, w)&lt;\\eta\\). Claim: \\(w&#39;\\) cannot exist on \\([z, z&#39;]\\), else contradicting the maximality of \\(x\\): Assuming by contradiction, \\(d(x, w&#39;) \\leq d(x, w) + d(w, w&#39;) &lt; 2\\eta\\), then \\[ d(z, w&#39;) \\geq d(x, z)_{&gt;4\\eta} - d(x, w&#39;)_{&lt;2\\eta} &gt; 2\\eta &gt; d(x, w&#39;) \\implies d(x, z&#39;) &lt; d(z, z&#39;) \\] Then \\(d(x, \\gamma) \\leq d(x, z&#39;) &lt; d(z, z&#39;) = d(z, \\gamma)\\), contradicting the maximality of \\(x\\). Combining the two results, we obtain \\(d(x, \\gamma) &lt; 2\\eta\\). For one of \\(t, L-t &lt; 4\\eta\\), assume w.l.o.g. that \\(t&lt;4\\eta\\) and apply the same construction to the geodesic triangle \\([\\gamma_0, z, z&#39;]\\). For the trivial case \\(t, L-t &lt; 4\\eta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) is a geodesic. Figure 3.1: Hypothetical (for contradiction) constructions are in green. Geodesics are in blue. Dehn algorithm This part follows section 7.4.1, which efficiently solves the word problem for hyperbolic groups. The main idea of the proof is as follows: By lemma 3.3, local geodesics are close to global geodesics. This implies the shortcut lemma 3.4, which means that every loop in the Cayley graph (which is piecewise geodesic) of a hyperbolic group contains a geodesic shortcut. Null-homotopic words correspond to loops in the Cayley graph, and Dehn relations correspond to rules with which to “shrink” the loops. The shortcut lemma implies the existence of a Dehn presentation in which loops can always be shrunk to a smaller loops. Definition 3.5 (Dehn presentation) A finite presentation \\(\\langle S|R\\rangle\\) is a Dehn presentation if there exists words \\((u_1, v_1), \\dots, (u_n, v_n)\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\) such that \\(R = \\{u_1 v_1^{-1}, \\dots, u_n v_n^{-1}\\}\\). For all \\(j\\), \\(|v_j| \\leq |u_j|\\). For all nontrivial null-homotopic words \\(w\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\), some \\(u_j\\) is a subword of \\(w\\). Note that \\(v_j\\) can be null. For example, the free group of rank \\(2\\) has Dehn representation \\(v_1=\\dots=v_4=1\\), and \\[ u_1 = xx^{-1}, \\quad u_2=x^{-1}x, \\quad u_3=yy^{-1}, \\quad u_4=y^{-1}y \\] Given a Dehn presentation, the word problem is solvable in time \\(O(|w|)\\) by a replacement algorithm. Lemma 3.4 (shortcuts in cycles in hyperbolic groups) Given an \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic group \\(G\\), a finite generating set \\(S\\) and \\(\\Delta(G, S)\\) being \\(\\eta\\)-hyperbolic, if \\(\\gamma:[0, n]\\to \\Delta(N, G)\\) is a piecewise-geodesic cycle (of length \\(n\\)), then there exists a restriction \\(\\gamma_{[t, t&#39;]}\\) with \\(t, t&#39;\\in [0, n]\\) such that \\[ L(\\gamma_{[t, t&#39;]}) \\leq 8\\eta \\] and such that \\(\\gamma_{|[t, t&#39;]}\\) is not geodesic. Proof: The lemma equivalently claims that there is no \\(c_{&gt;8\\eta}\\)-local geodesic cycle, and we argue by contradiction. Since \\(\\gamma\\) is a loop, we first have \\(n&gt;8\\eta\\). By lemma 3.3, \\(\\gamma\\) is \\(2\\eta\\)-close to the trivial geodesic at \\(\\gamma_0\\), so \\(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma\\) is in the \\(2\\eta\\)-ball centered at \\(\\gamma_0\\). Then we obtain the following contradiction (the last equality follows by the local geodesic condition): \\[ 4\\eta \\geq \\mathrm{diam}\\, B_{2\\delta}(\\gamma_0) \\geq d(\\gamma_0, \\gamma_{5\\eta}) = 5\\eta \\] Note that the \\(8\\eta\\) here is inherited from lemma 3.3. Theorem 3.1 (Dehn presentations and hyperbolic groups) Given a hyperbolic group \\(G\\) and a finite generating set \\(S\\), there exists a finite set \\(R\\subset (S\\cup S^{-1})^*\\) such that \\(\\langle S|R\\rangle\\) is a Dehn presentation of \\(G\\). Proof: Consider the canonical presentation \\(\\pi:F(S)\\to G\\). Using the shortcut lemma, consider the finite set \\[ R = \\left\\{ uv^{-1} \\,|\\, u, v\\in (S\\cup S^{-1})^*: d(1, \\pi(u)) &lt; |u| \\leq \\lceil 8\\eta\\rceil + 2, \\,\\, |v|=d(1, \\pi(u)), \\,\\,\\pi(u)=\\pi(v) \\right\\} \\tag{3.2} \\] The interpretation for each constraint are: \\(|v|=d_s(1, \\pi(u))\\): \\(v\\) is the geodesic connecting the identity to \\(u\\), i.e.  the word \\(v\\) is the “canonical word” representing \\(u\\). \\(\\pi(u)=\\pi(v)\\): the geometric realization of \\(uv^{-1}\\) forms a loop. The canonical isomorphism \\(\\pi/\\langle R\\rangle^{\\unlhd}:\\langle S|R\\rangle\\to G\\) is surjective by the \\(\\pi(u)=\\pi(v)\\) constraint, and we next argue that it is injective, i.e.  every null-homotopic word satisfies \\(w\\in \\langle R\\rangle^{\\unlhd}\\). This can be argued inductively by applying the shortcut lemma: If \\(w\\) contains a subword \\(ss^{-1}\\), then \\((ss^{-1})1\\in R\\). Remove \\(ss^{-1}\\) by conjugating \\(w=a(ss^{-1})b\\) with \\(a(s^{-1}s)a^{-1}\\) and apply the inductive hypothesis. If \\(w\\) contains no subword of the form \\(ww^{-1}\\), then \\(w\\) realizes a cycle; apply the shortcut lemma to obtain \\(w=w&#39;uw&#39;&#39;\\) and replace \\(u\\mapsto v\\) by conjugation, the apply the inductive hypothesis. Gromov-boundaries This section discusses the relevant results in Chapter 8 of (Löh 2017). Intuitively, the definition of boundary should satisfy: To every metric space \\(X\\) a (preferably compact) topological space \\(X_\\infty\\). Quasi-isometric invariance: \\(X\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(X&#39;\\iff X_\\infty\\) is homeomorphic to \\(X&#39;_\\infty\\). Functoriality: a quasi-isometric embedding \\(X\\to Y\\) induces a continuous map \\(X_\\infty\\to Y_\\infty\\) compatible with composition: \\((g\\circ f)_\\infty = g_\\infty\\circ f_\\infty\\), for \\(f, g\\) quasi-isometric embeddings. The main idea is to define points on the boundary as equivalence classes of geodesic rays. Definition 3.6 (Gromov boundary) Two quasi-geodesic rays \\(\\gamma, \\gamma&#39;:[0, \\infty)\\to X\\) are equivalent if they have finite Hausdorff distance, i.e. \\(\\exists c&gt;0\\) such that \\[ \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma \\subset B_c(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39;), \\quad \\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma&#39; \\subset B_c(\\mathrm{im}\\, \\gamma) \\] The Gromov boundary is defined as the set of quasi-geodesic rays modulo \\(\\sim\\) above, with the topology defined as follows: Given \\((x_n), x\\subset \\partial X\\), we say \\(x_n\\to x\\) if there exists representative rays \\((\\gamma_n), \\gamma\\) such that every subsequence of \\((\\gamma_n)\\) contains a subsequence which converges to \\(\\gamma\\) uniformly on compact subsets of \\([0, \\infty)\\). Importantly, the Gromov boundary of \\(\\mathbb H^n\\) is \\(S^{n-1}\\) ((Löh 2017), Example 8.3.5). Theorem 3.2 (quasi-isometric invariance of Gromov boundary) For two geodesic metric spaces \\(X, X&#39;\\), we have \\(\\partial X\\cong \\partial X&#39;\\iff X, X&#39;\\) are quasi-isometric to one another. The immediate implications of this result are as follows: The Gromov boundaries of hyperbolic groups are well-defined as the Gromov boundaries of their Cayley graphs, regardless of the generating sets. Groups which are quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) have Gromov boundary \\(S^2\\). Quasi-isometry of Cayley Graphs Proposition 3.1 (Loh (5.2.5)) Given \\(G\\) finitely generated by \\(S, S&#39;\\), the identity map \\(1_G\\) is a bilipschitz equivalence between \\((G, d_S)\\) and \\((G, d_{S&#39;})\\). Proof: Define \\(c=\\max_{s\\in S\\cup S^{-1}} d_{S&#39;}(1, s)\\). Note that the distance is in \\(s&#39;\\). Using the left-invariance of the metric, for arbitrary \\(g, h\\in G\\), let \\(g^{-1}h = s_1\\dots s_n\\) in \\(S\\cup S^{-1}\\) be the geodesic connecting \\(g, h\\), then \\[\\begin{align} d_{S&#39;}(g, h) &amp;= d_{S&#39;}(g, gs_1\\dots s_n) \\leq d_{S&#39;}(g, gs_1) + d_{S&#39;}(gs_1, gs_1s_2) + \\dots \\\\ &amp;= d_{S&#39;}(1, s_1) + \\dots + d_{S&#39;}(1, s_n) \\leq cn = cd_S(g, h) \\end{align}\\] Interesting Misc The Gromov boundary of free groups (of nontrivial rank) are Cantor sets, which is not homeomorphic to \\(S^1\\). Since Gromov boundary is a quasi-isometric invariant, it follows that nontrivial free groups are not quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic space \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). This can be seen intuitively by the fact that the the “leaves” of a tree are not translationally homogeneous: radial geodesics which diverge at an earlier root differ from those which diverge at a later root, even if the two pairs can have the same angular separation.

"],["covering-theory.html", "4 Covering theory Topological preliminaries Švarc–Milnor lemma", " 4 Covering theory This section recounts the theory of universal covers for “nice” topological spaces. In particular, we aim to understand (and program) how the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic \\(3\\)-manifolds can be represented by matrix subgroups of the isometry group of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\), and how such representations can be visualized as “lattice tilings” of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). Review the basics of covering theory. We revisit the proof of the Švarc–Milnor lemma (Loh, 5.4), which gives an explicit construction of the quasi-isometric embedding of the Cayley graph of a fundamental group into the universal cover. To obtain the quasi-isometry constants of the embedding \\(\\Delta(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold}), \\{a, b\\})\\), we: Compute the generating set \\(S\\) of \\(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold})\\) according to the Švarc–Milnor lemma. Compute the quasi-isometry constants of the embedding \\(\\Delta(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold}), S)\\). Use the fact that \\(\\Delta(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold}), \\{a, b\\})\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(\\Delta(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold}), S)\\). Topological preliminaries See Loh (A.1.2) and Munkres for more details. Here we recount the basics of covering theory. Every “nice” topological space has a universal cover \\(\\widetilde X\\) which is simply connected. The space \\(\\widetilde X\\) admits a free, properly discontinuous group action of \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\). There is a homeomorphism from \\(\\widetilde X\\) modulo \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\) to \\(X\\) by sending \\(x_0\\) to the class of \\(\\widetilde x_0\\). In a sense \\(X\\) is a “representative pancake” in \\(\\widetilde X\\). If \\(X\\) is a metric space, then \\(\\widetilde X\\) carries the induced path-metric and the action of \\(\\pi_1(X, x_0)\\) is isometric, so fundamental groups are subgroups of the isometry group of the universal cover. Some more results about hyperbolic spaces: Using the hyperboloid model of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) as the \\(x_0&gt;0\\) slice of \\(\\mathbb R^4\\) under the contour equation \\(-x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1\\), we obtain \\[ \\mathrm{Isom}\\, \\mathbb H^3 = O^+(3, 1) \\] where \\(O^+(3, 1)\\) is the group of proper orthochronous Lorentz transformations which keep the upper-sheet of the hyperboloid invariant. A standard result has \\(\\mathrm{SO}^+(3, 1)\\cong \\mathrm{PSL}(2, \\mathbb C)\\), i.e. there is a \\(2\\)-to-\\(1\\) covering \\(\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb C)\\to \\mathrm{SO}^+(3, 1)\\). Need to double-check: for orientable closed manifolds (e.g. the Weeks manifold?), the deck transformations are orientation-preserving, so \\(\\pi_1(\\text{Weeks manifold}) \\subset \\mathrm{SO}^+(3, 1)\\). Švarc–Milnor lemma Theorem 4.1 (Švarc–Milnor lemma) Given the group action of \\(G\\) on a non-empty metric space \\((X, d)\\) such that \\(\\forall g: x\\mapsto g\\cdot x\\) is an isometry. Further suppose that \\(X\\) is \\((c, b)\\)-quasi-geodesic and that there is a subset \\(B\\subset X\\) such that: \\(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B\\) is finite. The \\(G\\)-translates of \\(B\\) cover \\(X\\) (not necessarily disjoint). Let \\(B&#39;\\) be the \\(2b\\)-thickening of \\(B\\), the set \\(S = \\{g\\in G \\, | \\, g\\cdot B&#39;\\cap B&#39;\\neq \\emptyset\\}\\) is finite. The generating set \\(S\\) is geometrically the neighboring set which sends the thickenedfundamental domain \\(B&#39;\\) to overlapping neighboring translations. Then the following holds: \\(G\\) is finitely generated by \\(S\\). Fixing any basepoint \\(x\\in X\\), the Cayley graph of \\(G\\) is quasi-isometric to \\(X\\) by the map \\[ G\\xrightarrow {g\\mapsto g\\cdot x} X \\] In particular, we obtain the following quasi-isometric bound: \\[ \\dfrac b {c^2} d_S(e, g) - b \\left(\\dfrac 1 {c^2} - 1\\right) \\leq d(x, g\\cdot x) \\leq 2(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) \\cdot d_S(e, g) \\tag{4.1} \\] Proof: The proof proceeds as follows: Proving that \\(S\\) generates \\(G\\): given \\(g\\in G\\), connect \\(x, g\\cdot x\\) by a quasi-geodesic, then divide the geodesic into sufficiently fine intervals with endpoints covered by \\(g_j\\) such that \\(g_{j-1}\\cdot B&#39;\\cap g_j\\cdot B&#39;\\) is nonempty, so that \\(g_{j-1}^{-1}g_j\\) is in the neighboring set. Proving that \\(g\\mapsto g\\cdot x\\) is a quasi-dense: follows from the tiling of \\(X\\) by \\(G\\)-translates of \\(B\\). Proving that \\(g\\mapsto g\\cdot x\\) is a quasi-isometric embedding: Use the lower bound provided by the quasi-geodesicity. Upper-bound using the fact that subsequent endpoints \\((x_j)\\) cannot be too far apart. Fix \\(g\\in G\\) for which we wish to show that \\(g\\in \\langle S\\rangle_G\\). Choose any \\(x\\in B\\) and construct a \\((c, b)\\)-quasi-geodesic \\(\\gamma:[0, L]\\to X\\) connecting \\(x\\) and ending in \\(g\\cdot x\\). Divide up the interval \\([0, L]\\) into sufficiently fine intervals such that \\(x_0=x, x_n=g\\cdot x\\), and that \\(d(x_{j-1}, x_j) \\leq c\\cdot |t_{j-1}-t_j|_{\\leq b/c} + b \\leq 2b\\). We proceed to show that \\(\\forall j\\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\), \\[ s_j = g_{j-1}^{-1} g_j \\in S = \\{g\\in G \\, | \\, g\\cdot B&#39;\\cap B&#39;\\neq \\emptyset\\} \\] To show this, \\(x_j\\in B_{2b}(g_{j-1}\\cdot B) = g_{j-1}\\cdot B_{2b}(B) = g_{j-1}\\cdot B&#39;\\). Similarly, \\(x_j\\in g_j\\cdot B\\subset g_j\\cdot B&#39;\\) so \\(g_{j-1}\\cdot B&#39;\\cap g_j\\cdot B&#39; \\supset \\{x_j\\}\\) and \\(s_j=g_{j-1}^{-1}\\cdot g_j\\in S\\). Then \\[ g = g_n = g_{n-1} g_{n-1}^{-1} g_n = g_{n-1}s_n = g_{n-2}s_{n-1}s_n = \\cdots = s_1\\cdots s_n \\in \\langle S\\rangle \\] To show that \\(\\varphi:g\\mapsto g\\cdot x\\) is quasi-dense, simply note that the quasi-dense constant is bounded by \\(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B\\) since the \\(g\\)-translates of \\(B\\) cover \\(X\\). To next show that \\(\\varphi\\) is a quasi-isometric embedding, using the isometric condition \\(g(\\varphi\\, g, \\varphi\\, h) = d(e, \\varphi(g^{-1}h))\\) and \\(d_S(g, h) = d_S(e, g^{-1}h)\\) we obtain Lower bound \\(d(x, g\\cdot x)\\) in terms of \\(d_S(e, g)\\): let \\(\\gamma\\) be a quasi-geodesic from \\(x\\) to \\(g\\cdot x\\) as in the first part, then noting that \\(d_S(e, g) \\leq n\\) (since \\(g=s_1\\dots s_n\\)) we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} d(x, g\\cdot x) &amp;= d(\\gamma_0, \\gamma_L) \\geq \\dfrac 1 c L - b \\geq \\dfrac 1 c \\cdot \\dfrac{b}{c}(n-1) - b \\\\ &amp;= \\dfrac{b}{c^2} \\cdot n - \\dfrac{b}{c^2} - b \\geq \\dfrac b {c^2}d_S(e, g) - \\dfrac{b}{c^2} - b \\end{align*}\\] Upper bound of \\(d(x, g\\cdot x)\\) in terms of \\(d_S(e, g)\\): let \\(d_S(e, g)=n\\) so that \\(g=s_1\\dots s_n\\) with \\(s_j\\in S\\cup S^{-1}\\). Then using the triangle inequality, the isometric condition \\(d(g\\cdot x, g\\cdot y)=d(x, y)\\), we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} d(x, g\\cdot x) &amp;\\leq d(x, s_1\\cdot x) + d(s_1\\cdot x, s_1\\cdot s_2\\cdot x) + \\cdots + d(s_1\\cdots s_{n-1}\\cdot x, s_1\\cdots s_n\\cdot x) \\\\ &amp;= d(x, s_1\\cdot x) + d(x, s_2\\cdot x) + \\dots + d(x, s_n\\cdot x) \\\\ &amp;\\leq n\\cdot 2(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) \\leq 2(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) \\cdot d_S(e, g) \\end{align*}\\] In the last line we used the fact that \\(\\forall x, s\\in S = \\{g\\in G \\, | \\, g\\cdot B&#39;\\cap B&#39;\\neq \\emptyset\\}\\), we have \\(d(x, s\\cdot x) \\leq 2(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b)\\): let \\(y\\in s\\cdot B&#39;\\cap B&#39;\\), then \\[ d(x, s\\cdot x) \\leq d(x, y) + d(y, s\\cdot x) \\leq (\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) + (\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) \\] Corollary 4.1 (fundamental groups and universal covers) Given a compact, boundaryless Riemannian manifold \\(M\\) with universal cover \\(\\widetilde M\\), the fundamental group \\(\\pi_1(M)\\) is finitely-generated and for every basepoint \\(x\\in \\widetilde M\\), the map \\[ \\pi_1(M)\\xrightarrow {g\\mapsto g\\cdot x} \\widetilde M \\] given by the action of the fundamental group on \\(\\widetilde M\\) by deck transformations (analogous to reshuffling pancakes) is a quasi-isometry with bound \\[ b \\cdot d_S(e, g) \\leq d(x, g\\cdot x) \\leq 2(\\mathrm{diam}\\, B + 2b) \\cdot d_S(e, g) \\tag{4.2} \\] Note that varying \\(b\\) will vary the generating set S. Proof: The action of deck transformations for closed Riemannian manifolds is isometric, proper, and cocompact. Also note that \\(\\widetilde M\\) is \\((1, b)\\)-quasi-geodesic for every \\(b\\in \\mathbb R_{&gt;0}\\). Given such action, we simply choose \\(B=M\\) in theorem 4.1. To obtain the claimed bound, substitute \\(c=1\\) in (4.1). "],["quasi-isometries-in-practice.html", "5 Quasi-isometries in Practice Quasi-isometry of 1D MERA Cayley Graph of the Weeks Group Hyperbolic Surfaces", " 5 Quasi-isometries in Practice Quasi-isometry of 1D MERA In this section, we intuitively demonstrate how the tensor network graph of a 1D MERA is quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). Below is a graphical representation of a 1D MERA: Isometry tensors are denoted by blue dots. Disentanger unitaries are denoted by orange. The graphical representation starts from 4 sites. The disentanglers are put on the same radius as the branching isometries. Concretely, the MERA graph is specified as follows: At radius \\(r\\), there are \\(\\sim^{(8\\cdot)} 2^r\\) vertices in a regular polygon. The odd and even vertices correspond to isometries and disentanglers, respectively. Each disentangler at \\(r\\) is connected to two isometries at \\(r+1\\). We next consider the behavior of geodesics in the 1D MERA. The highlighted paths are all geodesics from endpoints on the boundary. The graph of the 1D MERA with disentanglers should be quasi-isometric to the graph below, after identifying the disentanglers with the isometries using local transformations (quasi-isometries only care about global properties). The geodesics in the following graph between two points at the same radius separated by angle \\(\\theta\\) are determined by the following greedy rule: Connecting two points by an arc has distance \\(\\sim 2^r \\theta\\). Alternatively, we can reduce to \\(r\\mapsto r-1\\) by extending the connecting path radially towards the center. In particular, we see that the simplified graph captures: Exponential growth of the hyperbolic circumference w.r.t. the hyperbolic radius. Sideways connections by an angular arc (enabled by disentanglers). The fundamental reason why a TTN (MERA without disentanglers) is not quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\) is that the tree structure only captures (1), but not (2). The metric for \\(\\mathbb H^2\\) under \\((\\rho, \\theta)\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the hyperbolic radius, and \\(\\theta\\) the angle, is \\[ ds^2 = d\\rho^2 + \\sinh^2(\\rho) d\\theta^2 \\xrightarrow{\\rho \\to \\infty} d\\rho^2 + \\dfrac{e^{2\\rho}}{4} d\\theta^2 \\] Both the \\(d\\rho\\) and \\(e^\\rho \\, d\\theta\\) terms are faithfully represented by the graph structure via the visual embedding below, so that the 1D MERA graph is quasi-isometric to \\(\\mathbb H^2\\). Cayley Graph of the Weeks Group Recalling the Svarc-Milnor lemma, we have an explicit embedding of the Cayley graph of the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold into \\(\\mathbb H^3\\) by the tiling generated by the fundamental domain . We retrieved the Dirichlet domain and its associated face-pairing transformations from SnapPy. The Dirichlet domain is a canonical method for visualizing the fundamental domain of a manifold within its universal cover. The face-pairing transformations send the Dirichlet domain to its neighbors, effectively generating a regular tiling of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\). The vertices of the Svarc-Milnor Cayley graph are the centers of the Dirichlet domains, with edges connecting vertices of neighboring domains. The Weeks Dirichlet domain has 26 vertices, 42 edges, and 18 faces. So the boundary grows approximately as \\(18^r\\). I only visualized the immediate neighbors of the center and the Cayley graph up to \\(r=2\\), to reduce clutter. Toggle the right-hand side to visualize specific components. Hyperbolic Surfaces The Poincaré ball model of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\cong B_1(0)\\) is equipped with the Riemmanian metric \\[ ds^2 = \\dfrac{4(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)}{(1-r^2)^2}, \\quad g_{ab} = \\dfrac 4 {(1-r^2)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\] Proposition 5.1 (Poincaré's and hyperbolic radius) The length \\(\\rho\\) of a radial line which goes from \\(r=0\\) to \\(r=R\\) is \\(\\rho = 2\\, \\mathrm{arctanh}\\, R\\). Proof: The radial scaling factor of length is \\(2/(1-r^2)\\). Integrating this yields \\[ \\rho = \\int_0^R dr\\, \\dfrac{2}{1-r^2} = \\log \\dfrac{1+R}{1-R} = 2\\, \\mathrm{arctanh}\\, R \\] Proposition 5.2 (hyperbolic sector area) The area \\(A\\) of the hyperbolic sector subtended by angle \\(\\phi\\) and Poincaré radius \\(R\\in (0, 1)\\) is \\[ A = \\dfrac{2\\phi}{1/R^2 - 1} \\] Proof: The Jacobian of the inclusion map and the induced metric \\(g&#39;\\) in \\((\\theta, r)\\) coordinates are, respectively, \\[\\begin{align} J &amp;= T\\, \\iota = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial_{\\theta }(r\\cos\\theta) &amp; \\partial_{\\theta }(r\\sin\\theta) &amp; 0 \\\\ \\partial_{r} (r\\cos\\theta) &amp; \\partial_{r} (r\\sin\\theta) &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -r\\sin\\theta &amp; r\\cos\\theta &amp; 0 \\\\ \\cos\\theta &amp; \\sin\\theta &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ g&#39; &amp;= JgJ^T = \\dfrac 4 {(1-r^2)^2} \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 \\\\ &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\sqrt{\\det g&#39;} = \\dfrac{4r}{(1-r^2)^2} \\end{align}\\] Direct integration yields the desired area: \\[\\begin{align} A = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\phi \\sqrt{\\det g&#39;} \\, d\\theta \\, dr &amp;= \\phi \\int_0^R \\dfrac{4r}{(1-r^2)^2} \\, dr = \\phi \\dfrac{2R^2}{1-R^2} = \\dfrac{2\\phi}{1/R^2 - 1} \\end{align}\\] Proposition 5.3 (hyperbolic arc length) The length \\(L\\) of the arc subtended by angle \\(\\phi\\) and Poincaré radius \\(R\\) is \\[ L = \\dfrac{2R\\phi}{1-R^2} \\] Proof: The inclusion map \\(\\iota&#39;\\) of the curve has Jacobian \\(J&#39; = (-R\\sin\\theta, R\\cos\\theta, 0)\\). The induced metric and length follows: \\[ g&#39;&#39; = J&#39; g (J&#39;)^T = \\dfrac{4R^2}{(1-R^2)^2}, \\quad \\sqrt{\\det g&#39;&#39;} = \\dfrac{2R}{1-R^2} \\implies L = \\dfrac{2R\\phi}{1-R^2} \\] Proposition 5.4 (area law for hyperbolic spherical surfaces) Consider a surface \\(S\\) on a hyperbolic sphere of radius \\(\\rho\\in (0, \\infty)\\). Let \\(A\\) be the lateral area of the radial cone covering \\(S\\). We have \\[ A = \\tanh(\\rho/2) |\\partial S| \\leq |\\partial S| \\] Figure 5.1: Hypothetical (for contradiction) constructions are in green. Geodesics are in blue. Proof: Comparing propositions 5.2 and 5.3, we obtain \\(A = RL\\). Take the infinitesimal limit \\((A, L)\\mapsto (dA, d|\\partial S|)\\) and integrate to yield \\(A = R|\\partial S| = \\tanh(\\rho/2) |\\partial S| \\leq |\\partial S|\\). Hypothesis 5.1 (area law for hyperbolic MERAs) For MERAs representing a Cayley graph generated by neighboring transformations per the Svarc-Milnor lemma, the area law is satisfied in the asymptotic limit of small lattices. Proof: The area law follows from proposition 5.4 if the following two claims are true: Given a subsystem \\(B\\) of the lattice embedded on a hyperbolic sphere, the area (size) of the subsystem is faithfully represented by the hyperbolic area \\(S\\) as in proposition 5.4. The number of tensor legs crossing the lateral surface of the radial cone covering \\(B\\) is proportional to the lateral area \\(A\\) of the surface. Note that the Cayley graph represents a regular tiling of \\(\\mathbb H^3\\), so that in the small-tile limit: The hyperbolic area of a surface is approximated by the number of tiles intersecting the surface up to constant factors. I’m imagining cubical volume elements in Euclidean space: the area of a surface is approximated by the number of cubical volume elements intersecting the surface. We can approximate the surface as a plane in the small-tile limit, so the number of tile intersections is approximated by the number of graph-edge cuts up to constant factors. In the Euclidean space, the intersection of a cubical volume element with a plane (assuming no intersection with vertices) cuts between \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) edges. Combining the two observations, the number of tensor legs crossing the lateral surface and the radial patch are both proportional to the hyperbolic area of the surfaces.
