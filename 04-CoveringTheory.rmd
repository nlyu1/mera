# Covering theory (in progress)

This section recounts the theory of universal 
covers for "nice" topological spaces. 

In particular, we aim to understand (and program) how the 
fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds can be 
represented by matrix subgroups of the isometry group of $\mbb H^3$ 
(Mobius transforms?). 

## Universal covers, deck transforms {-}

This section recounts relevant results for how the 
fundamental groups of metric manifolds may be embedded as subgroups 
of the universal covers' isometry group. 

## Isometry group of $\mbb H^3$ {-}

This section entails the matrix representation of 
the isometry group of $\mbb H^3$. 

## Matrix representation of $\pi_1$ {-}

This section computes the matrix representation of select closed 3-manifolds.
