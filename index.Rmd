# Research agenda 

1. Identify "nice" groups with Gromov boundary $S^2$. 
2. Construct their Cayley graphs out to a fixed radius, 
    embedding endpoints on $S^2$. 
3. Investigate the minimal-surface property of the Cayley graphs 
    (at least an upper-bound) 

## Progress log {-}

Main takeaways so far: 

1. $\partial \mbb H^3\cong S^2$, and quasi-isometric metric spaces have 
    the same Gromov boundary, so it suffices to find groups which are 
    quasi-isometric to $\mbb H^3$. 
2. By the Svarc-Milnor lemma (Corollary 5.4.13 in [@loh2017geometric]), 
    the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds have Gromov boundary $S^2$. 

Examples of groups with $S^2$ Gromov boundary (from Regina): 

- m003(-3, 1): $\la a, b| a^2b^2a^2b^{-1}ab^{-1}, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\ra$. 
- m003(-2, 3): $\la a, b|a^{-1}b^{-1}aba^{-1}bab^{-1}a^{-1}b^2, ab^{-1}a^{-1}baba^{-1}b^{-1}ab^3\ra$. 
- m003(-4, 3): $\la a, b|a^2bab^{-2}ab, a^2b^2a^{-1}ba^{-1}b^2\ra$. 
- m003(-4, 1): $\la a, b|a^{-3}b^2abab^2, aba^3b^{-2}a^3b\ra$. 

### Jan 16: the word problem for candidate groups {-}

See section 3 for more details on (1-4) below. 
The approach in (5) is in progress in section 4. 

1. <u>We have identified a class of hyperbolic groups with Gromov boundary $S^2$</u>, 
    corresponding to the fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds. 
    - We obtained a "census" of this set of groups from Regina's database. 
    - Additionally, the database sorted the stored groups by the hyperbolic volume 
    of its corresponding manifold, which roughly concurs with the simplicity of the presentation 
    (number of generators, and length of the relations). 
2. There seems to be no established technology for 
    <u>constructing the Cayley graphs</u> of such groups (up to a certain radius). 
    - Mathematica supports plotting Cayley graphs but only for finite-order groups. 
3. Computing the Cayley graphs requires <u>solving the word problem</u>.  
4. My first attempt has been understanding and implementing the Dehn algorithm, 
    which yields a linear-time algorithm for solving the word problem. 
    - After carefully reading the proof (in hopes of understanding the algorithm), 
    I found that the Dehn algorithm is quite computationally infeasible. 
    Computing the Dehn presentation has exponential complexity in the hyperbolic constant, 
    which is likely exponentially-intractible as well. 
5. I'm looking more into aother approach to solving the word problem: 
    by representing the fundamental group as subgroups of the isometry group of 
    the universal cover $\mbb H^3$ (which should be the group of Mobius transforms, 
    which admit a convenient matrix representation?). 
    I intend to proceed by the following: 
    - Understand the isomorphism between fundamental groups and deck transformations. 
    - Understand the embedding of deck transformations into the isometry 
    group of the universal cover. 
    - Understand the matrix representation of the isometry group of $\mbb H^2$. 
    - Compute the matrix representations of select hyperbolic groups, solve the 
    word problem, and write a program to compute the Cayley graphs. 

The resulting Cayley graph may not have neat tree-like structure. 
There is a chance that in order to understand which edges should correspond to 
the lattice sites (and to compute the size of a boundary patch), 
I may also need to dig into the construction of the quasi-isometry 
between the $\pi_1$ of closed hyperbolic $3$-manifolds and $\mbb H^3$.
